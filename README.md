# RpiWiFiOpcUaServer
This project is meant to give access to the WiFi interface of a Raspberry Pi 3 via Opc UA server interface, which is commonly available in all major SCADA and HMI systems. This way, the SCADA or HMI operator will be able to provide Rpi connectivity by using his own mobile phone as an hotspot.
